# Newer setup tools creates entry point scripts which do things like:
#
#        try:
#            from importlib import metadata
#        except ImportError: # for Python<3.8
#            import importlib_metadata as metadata
#
# This causes the IPS dependency resolver to assume that both importlib and
# importlib_metadata should exist, when in fact one is for Python < 3.8 and
# one is for later versions. Depending on the python version, one or the other
# will fail to be found.
#
# Therefore we bypass resolution of these dependencies.
