This patch is partially based on one from
  https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland

This is a workaround to reduce the risk of damage to IPS delivered Python
packages by `pip` operations.

This patch prevents pip from uninstalling anything from the vendor-packages
folder. Pip can still see all packages in the vendor-packages folder (for
dependency resolution) but cannot remove them. This prevents pip from
uninstalling IPS related packages and thus breaking the system.

Updating a system package via pip will now result in the new being installed
into the site-packages folder, and the old being left in place. This retains
the version that is needed for system tools like `pkg` because these tools
explicitly ignore the `site-packages` area.

All to-be-deleted paths are checked whether they start with the vendor-packages
path. normalize_path is used mainly to correctly resolve symlinks.

This patch only helps as long as `pip` itself is not upgraded. If that happens
then there are two installed versions of `pip`, one in each of
`{site,vendor}-packages` and the new, unpatched, `pip` will start to be used.

To protect against that, we also patch `pip` to stop prompting users to
upgrade it, and to disallow updates of itself.

Furthermore the system packages are installed in such a way that pip will not
remove them since it thinks they were installed with distutils. See
python_vendor_relocate() in lib/functions.sh for more details.
