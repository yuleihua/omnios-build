# The aliases file is of the format
# 	nam: dest1 dest2 ...
# In this case, mails to nam will instead be delivered to dest1 and
# dest2, which in turn could be entries in /etc/aliases.  The special
# name '*' can be used to create a catch-all alias, which gets used
# if no other matching alias is found.  Use the catch-all alias only
# if you don't want any local mail to be delivered.
