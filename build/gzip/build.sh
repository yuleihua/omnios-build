# /usr/bin/uncompress is a hardlink to gunzip but is also delivered by
# system/extended-system-utilities. We therefore need to drop the version
# delivered with gzip but since it's a hardlink it is sometimes identified as
# a 'file' action and sometimes as 'hardlink'. Specify that gunzip should
# always be the target allowing uncompress to be dropped in local.mog
